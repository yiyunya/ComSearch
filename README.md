# ComSearch
code for EACL 2023 paper ComSearch: Equation Searching with Combinatorial Strategy for Solving Math Word Problems with Weak Supervision

Here is the code for generation of weakly supervised data. As cited in the paper, this code heavily relies on [Zhe Wang's algorithm for enumerating equations](https://github.com/MaigoAkisame/enumerate-expressions).
